## Changes to the Tech Stack

- **_Styled components_** => **_TailwindCSS_**

  - During the lest few months Ive been exploring more with TailwindCSS and getting more proficient at it, I believe that using TailwindCSS in substitution of Styled comonents will make my code more mantainable and scalable. For that reason the whole app was re disigned from the ground up utilizing Tailwind, all previous styles were discarded.

- **_React Redux => useContext_**
  - Although I believe React redux to be an amazing tool, this project could do much better with utilizing React in built hooks to manage states accross components. I am now much more familiar with the process and was able to create the same system I had made previously with Redux by simply using useContext, an extremely powerful tool by itself.

## Remaining work

- Completing the basic styling for the 3 main pages of the app
- Fixing the initial skill points assignment.
- Selecting a calendar framework to use, or building one from scratch.
- Reviewing the back end and ensuring the data is stored officiently.
- Designing the Pomodoro timers and adjusting the logic to implement them.
- Designing the leveling up process and its scalability.
