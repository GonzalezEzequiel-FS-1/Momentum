# Momentum App Maintenance Plan

## 1. Overview
Momentum is a full-stack productivity application designed to help users manage tasks, goals, and personal development. This document outlines the ongoing maintenance and support procedures to ensure stability, security, and performance.

## 2. Maintenance Objectives
- Ensure uptime and availability of both front-end and back-end services.
- Apply security updates to dependencies and frameworks.
- Monitor and fix bugs or issues promptly.
- Update documentation as new features are added.
- Backup database and critical files regularly.

## 3. Scheduled Maintenance
| Task | Frequency | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Dependency Updates | Monthly | Update NPM packages for both FrontEnd and Server folders. |
| Database Backup | Daily | Export MongoDB database to secure storage. |
| Security Audit | Quarterly | Check for vulnerabilities in dependencies, environment variables, and server configuration. |
| Performance Review | Bi-annually | Evaluate server performance, response times, and client load times. |

## 4. Monitoring
- **Server Logs:** Located in `Server/logs/server.log`. Review weekly for errors.
- **Crash Reporting:** Implement alerts for server crashes using monitoring tools.
- **Analytics:** Use `UseAnalytics.jsx` to track user interactions and identify potential bottlenecks.

## 5. Bug Reporting & Resolution
1. Report issues using a central system (e.g., GitHub Issues).
2. Assign severity: Critical, High, Medium, Low.
3. Resolve bugs in the codebase, test locally, then deploy updates.

## 6. Backup & Recovery
- **Database:** Daily automatic backups of MongoDB.
- **Files:** Weekly backup of `FrontEnd/dist/assets` and server files.
- **Recovery Procedure:** Restore from latest backup in case of data loss.

## 7. Version Control
- All updates must be committed to GitHub.
- Use feature branches for development and merge to `main` after testing.
- Tag releases with version numbers (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

## 8. Deployment
- FrontEnd: Vite build files located in `FrontEnd/dist`.
- Server: Node.js backend in `Server/`.
- Deployment scripts or instructions are in `INSTALL.md`.

## 9. Documentation
- Update `README.md` with any new features or changes.
- Keep `docs/` folder current with project plans, change orders, and research files.
