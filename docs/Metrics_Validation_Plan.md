# Metrics & Validation Plan

To ensure Momentum is solving real user problems and delivering value, I have identified the following key metrics:

## Key Metrics

- **User Activation Rate** – % of users who complete onboarding and create at least one goal or task
- **Daily/Weekly Active Users (DAU/WAU)** – Tracks user engagement
- **Goal Completion Rate** – Measures how effectively users complete their objectives
- **Task Streak Retention** – Indicates habit-building success
- **Feature Usage Analytics** – Helps us prioritize future development
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** – Gauges overall satisfaction
- **Churn Rate** – Measures long-term user retention
- **Time-to-First-Value (TTFV)** – How quickly a user benefits from using Momentum

### Validation Strategies

- **A/B Testing**: I will test onboarding flows, gamification elements, and UI variations to determine which designs increase engagement.
- **Use Case Testing**: I'll write use case scenarios to validate expected behavior from real users and ensure all key features are functioning as intended.
- **Beta Feedback**: Feedback will be collected from a small group of real users using structured forms and real-time messaging platforms.
- **Analytics Tools**: I'll implement analytics using tools like Plausible or Mixpanel to track user behavior, feature usage, and conversion events.
