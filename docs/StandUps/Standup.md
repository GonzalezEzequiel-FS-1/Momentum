# Portfolio IV Standup
# Week One
⚙️ Overview – What I Worked on This Past Week

This week, I focused on organizing the project repo, transitioning all styles to Tailwind CSS, and refining the sign-in/sign-up process. This included cleaning up old styling approaches, consolidating components, and ensuring UI consistency.

🌵 Challenges – What Problems I Had & How I’m Addressing Them

Tailwind Learning Curve: Getting comfortable with Tailwind’s utility-first approach, especially understanding and applying responsive breakpoints.
➤ I overcame this by reviewing the Tailwind docs and experimenting with layout adjustments.
Restricting the Application: Rebuilding certain parts of the app to accommodate Tailwind meant rethinking structure and layout logic.
➤ I treated it as a chance to refactor for better scalability and responsiveness.
🏆 Accomplishments – What I “Leveled Up” On

Gained a much deeper understanding of Tailwind CSS, particularly its responsive design system and how to apply it cleanly.
Cleaned up the codebase and eliminated legacy styles, making the project more maintainable and scalable moving forward.
🔮 Next Steps – What I Plan to Prioritize and Do Next:

Next week, my focus is on the backend integration:

Removing all dummy data from the application.
Implementing the trait system, tying frontend state to real backend responses.
Ensuring smooth user flows and validating data from backend endpoints.
