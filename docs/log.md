## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week  
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them  
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week  
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This week has been total chaos in my brain, so many ideas, but none of them seem to be "The one". But I think that after much thought I might have something good. I thought about a messaging app, a commercial app, but then, I went into a rabbit hole. What would be useful, what could be a project that when I go into an interview, the interviewer says, "I could see myself using this app". That should be my mentality, and I think I've got it. As a person with ADHD organizing my life is everyday a struggle. Something that helps me:

1. Organize my tasks
2. Prioritize my goals
3. Set a partner, mentor, or team
4. Share my goals with my partner or team
5. Gamify my goals
6. Message in between the team to keep on track
7. As a bonus, add achievements when certain criteria are met (days with all goals achieved etc.)

🌵 Challenges - Deciding what to do was definitely the most difficult part, but I think I've got something good going on. Also, splitting the time between my family, work, and school has been challenging for sure.  
🏆 Accomplishments - Well, I think that landing an idea in which I feel comfortable and challenged enough is the greatest accomplishment for this week.  
🔮 Next Steps - Shaping the idea, giving it a basic structure, deciding on a Stack and which libraries to use seems to be the most obvious next step. Once I get that sorted out I can move on forward. Before setting on the UI/UX etc., I want to know what the stack and libraries are capable of to see where my virtual limits lie.

### Week 2

⚙️ Overview - For this week, I focused on setting up my stylesheet, and coming up with a main design "direction". I selected the fonts I want, the colors, and how I want the main parts of the app to look like. I still need to work more on the actual design of the app, but I feel much more comfortable with how I want it to look like. From this main idea, I can now branch out and "see it" in my mind's eye. After having a mostly basic idea of the way it would look, I set my sights on delving into what I want the back end to achieve. At least how I'm visualizing this part is, similar to styling the front end, but in the back end. Building the structure to build upon, that way I can sit down and think on more advanced subjects without thinking about how I will get there.  
🌵 Challenges - Coming up with the styling was definitely a task on which I burned a few neurons. But After I got the main idea, building from that became exponentially easier. The biggest challenge this week was a completely self-imposed one, something that was not 100% required as far as this course work goes. After building the routes and connecting them with the front end, I quickly realized that I needed a way to manage my states early on. So I decided to integrate Redux at this stage. I have not had a lot of experience with Redux, so I can confidently say that it has been a learning curve. Also, time management was a huge challenge this week since family matters and work-related responsibilities got in between myself and actually working on the app as much as I would have liked.  
🏆 Accomplishments - I can 100% say that a major accomplishment for me this week was getting familiar with Redux, finally understanding what it does at a level that while wireframing how the app should work I can take it into account as much as I think on how my backend would interact with my frontend and vice versa. Also, I managed to set up authentication with Firebase and finally landed on a concept for the main styles of my app.  
🔮 Next Steps - Next week, apart from completing all of the class requirements, I want to keep building upon the concept and find a way to connect my thoughts into actual functionality. In order to do so, I think that some structure will be necessary. I will work on organizing a game plan, setting long and short term goals. If time allows, I would love to look into libraries that would help me create the app's functionality, looking into [React-Calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar) as a possible tool to integrate. Same as last week's post, I'm checking where my virtual limits lie, and when I find them, push them as much as I can.

### Week 3

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week

- Designed the initial trait system and level-up mechanics for user progression.
- Refined the XP allocation system based on user questionnaire responses.
- Explored how task complexity and categories affect XP gains in different traits.
- Considered class-based progression, but set it aside for now.

🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them

- **Balancing the leveling system:** Ensuring early levels progress faster while maintaining a meaningful long-term progression curve.  
  _Solution:_ Implemented an exponential XP requirement model.
- **Questionnaire scaling:** Moving from a 1-5 to a 1-10 scale while keeping it intuitive.  
  _Solution:_ Adjusted XP multipliers for higher granularity.
- **XP subtraction on form responses:** Deciding on a baseline to avoid negative XP values.  
  _Solution:_ Set a minimum threshold where the lowest value only reduces potential starting XP rather than going negative.

🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week

- Deepened my understanding of gamification mechanics in productivity apps.
- Improved balancing XP systems for meaningful progression.
- Designed a dynamic user onboarding system that personalizes starting stats based on their responses.

🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

- Implement the backend logic for XP allocation and leveling up.
- Define task categories and complexity scaling for trait-based XP gains.
- Prototype a user dashboard that visualizes their current progress and stats.

### Week 4

**FINAL SHOWDOWN!**

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week

- Implemented the foundational XP allocation system in the backend.
- Defined the structure for task categories and their impact on trait-based XP gains.
- Started prototyping the user dashboard for progress tracking.

🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them

- **Merge conflicts:** Had issues with a merge gone wrong and had to try multiple approaches to fix it.  
  _Solution:_ Resolved conflicts manually, reviewed commit history, and ensured data integrity.
- **XP scaling refinement:** Adjusting how different task complexities contribute to XP gains.  
  _Solution:_ Experimenting with tiered multipliers for various difficulty levels.
- **UI considerations for the dashboard:** Making progress visualization intuitive and engaging.  
  _Solution:_ Testing different graph and stat display methods for clarity.

🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week

- Gained more experience handling complex Git merges and conflict resolution.
- Built stronger backend logic for XP tracking and trait progression.
- Made significant strides in structuring task categorization for meaningful gameplay mechanics.

🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

- Finalize the XP scaling model for tasks.
- Enhance the dashboard UI for better engagement and clarity.
- Integrate task completion tracking with real-time stat updates.
