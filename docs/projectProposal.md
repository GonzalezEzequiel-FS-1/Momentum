# MOMENTUM <em> - ADHD Productivity, Redefined</em>

## Application Definition Statement

<details>
    <summary>Instructions</summary>
        <p style="font-size:.5rem">
            A clear high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to "What are you building?”. You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:.5rem">
            Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement.

        <p style="font-size:.5rem">
            Using Primary and Secondary research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.
        <br>
            Primary Research is research that you have conducted yourself and is not based on secondary sources. Examples of Primary Research include surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This doesn't have to be formal in nature and can include discussions you have with individuals that are likely users of your application. Secondary Research is research that has been conducted by others and is based on their findings. Examples of Secondary Research include market research reports, industry publications, and news articles.

## Use Cases
<details>
    <summary>Instructions</summary>
        <p style="font-size:.5rem">
            A 'Use Case' describes how a user may interact with your application. It provides a series of steps to reach a desired result. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout, how many clicks would it take to do that? Begin with a simple question like that and then map out the different steps to reach the desired goal. Use cases help us think through how our application will be used.*
        <br>
            Use Cases help drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. During development we regularly test and confirm the work in progress matches up with our Use Cases. This provides valuable insight into how our application is addressing the needs of the user and allows us to correct missteps early. This <a href="https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/use-case-testing/">article</a> gives additional background Use Cases and Use Case Testing.

## Problem Statement

<details>
    <summary>Instructions</summary>
        <p style="font-size:.5rem">
            In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.
        </p>
</details>
<span>
    <p style="margin-left:2rem;">
        Individuals with <strong>ADHD</strong> and similar conditions often struggle with <em>task management</em>, <em>goal prioritization</em>, and <em>maintaining focus</em> in a structured way. <em>Traditional</em> productivity tools lack the <strong>adaptability</strong> and <strong>motivational support</strong> needed to keep users engaged and on track. According to research <a href="#fdaGame" target="_blank"><sup id="ref5">[5]</sup></a>, people with ADHD benefit from <strong>visual organization</strong>, <strong>Gamification</strong>, and <strong>external accountability</strong> <a href="#pubmedAccountability" target="_blank" id="ref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> to reinforce <strong>task completion</strong>, and <strong>habit formation</strong>. However, existing solutions fail to integrate these elements <em>effectively</em>. This app is designed to bridge that gap by providing a customized, scientifically-backed productivity system tailored to the <strong>unique cognitive needs of ADHD users</strong> <a href="#evidenceConcStud" target="_blank" id="ref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, enhancing focus, motivation, and overall efficiency.
    </p>

## Pain Points
<details>
    <summary>Instructions</summary>
    <p style="font-size:.75rem;">
        Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.
    </p>
</details>
<span>
    <p>ADHD Users may present multiple pain pints that could be addressed by this app, below is a list of possible items</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Difficulty Maintaining focus:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Pain Point: </strong>
            People with ADHD often struggle to stay focused on tasks for extended periods of time, especially tasks that aren't immediately interesting or rewarding.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Impact on user: </strong>
            This can lead to procrastination, incomplete tasks, and feeling overwhelmed or frustrated when trying to meet deadlines. These focus challenges may contribute to lower productivity, work or school performance, and negatively affect personal relationships.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Example from Research: </strong>
            According to the study "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is characterized by a delay in cortical maturation" by P. Shaw et al. <a href="#focusChallengeRef" id="ref4b"><sup style="font-size:.5rem;">[4b]</sup></a>, ADHD is linked to delays in cortical maturation, which could contribute to challenges in focus and attention control.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Poor Time Management and Task Prioritization:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Pain Point: </strong>
            Managing time effectively and knowing what tasks to prioritize can be difficult for those with ADHD. They often find themselves caught up in less important tasks or become overwhelmed by the number of tasks they need to accomplish.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Impact on user: </strong>
             This can lead to poor productivity, missed deadlines, and feelings of anxiety or frustration. Without proper task prioritization and time management tools, users may often feel like they’re not accomplishing what they need to in a given day.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Example from Research: </strong>
            As stated in the article "What to know about time management in people with ADHD" Mathieu Rees <a href="#mntdArticle" id="ref13"><sup style="font-size:.5rem;">[13]</sup></a> states that "People with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can experience issues with time management. Sticking to routines, planning, and reframing ADHD may help those with this condition manage their time."
        </li>
        </ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of External Accountability:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Pain Point: </strong>
                Many individuals with ADHD struggle with self-motivation and rely on external sources of accountability to stay on track with tasks and goals. Without structure and reminders, they can easily get sidetracked.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Impact on user: </strong>
                This lack of external accountability leads to procrastination, missed deadlines, and feelings of failure. Individuals may struggle to maintain momentum without consistent, outside encouragement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Example from Research: </strong>
                The article "ADHD accountability buddy: How to find one and why you need one"<a href="#accountabilityBuddy" id="ref14"><sup style="font-size:.5rem;">[14]</sup ></a> explains in detail the importance of an <em>accountability buddy</em> can be helpful with ADHD patients, how it can help to avoid hyperfocus and maintain the individual centered on his current goals.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of Motivation and Reward System</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Pain Point: </strong>
                ADHD often causes individuals to lack motivation for tasks that don’t provide immediate rewards. This can cause them to neglect long-term goals or essential tasks that don’t have quick, obvious payoffs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Impact on user: </strong>
                Without a structured reward system, ADHD individuals may find it hard to remain consistent with long-term tasks, leading to procrastination and disengagement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Example from Research: </strong>
                Research in "Review of the Evidence for Motivation Deficits in Youth with ADHD and Their Association with Functional Outcomes " by Z Smith and K Langberg <a href="#motivationRef" id="ref15"><sup style="font-size:.5rem;">[15]</sup></a> indicates that individuals with ADHD may struggle with motivation due to an underactive reward system in the brain, making tasks that don’t offer an immediate reward system harder to complete.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
