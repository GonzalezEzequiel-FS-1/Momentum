# Momentum – Business Case Summary

## What is Momentum?

Momentum is a productivity and goal-setting web app designed to help individuals with ADHD stay focused, consistent, and motivated.

## Problem

People with ADHD often struggle with executive dysfunction, difficulty prioritizing tasks, inconsistent motivation, and the overwhelming nature of traditional to-do apps. These tools aren't built with neurodivergent users in mind and often increase frustration instead of reducing it.

## Solution

Momentum provides a focused, gamified, and science-informed environment that breaks down goals into achievable tasks. It integrates progress tracking, visual prioritization, rewards, and collaboration to support both individual users and small accountability groups or care teams.

## Target Audience

Momentum is built for adults and students with ADHD or similar executive function disorders. It’s also ideal for people who benefit from structured task organization, habit-building, and positive reinforcement.

## Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

Momentum focuses on accessibility, neurodivergent-centered UX, and science-backed gamification techniques. It doesn’t just organize tasks — it helps users build sustainable momentum, fostering confidence and real achievement.

## Monetization Strategy

Momentum will follow a freemium SaaS model:

- **Free Tier**: Core features like task creation, goal tracking, and limited habit streaks.
- **Premium Tier**: Includes collaboration tools, detailed progress analytics, advanced customization, and supportive ADHD productivity modules.
- **Institutional Licensing**: Optional business model to serve schools, clinics, and HR wellness programs.

## Additional Validation Work (2.3 Metrics & Analysis)

To strengthen the business case and prepare for the beta release, we created two GitHub issues focused on validation and analysis:

### Analytics Implementation  
[Issue #69](https://github.com/GonzalezEzequiel-FS-1/2503-WDV349-GonzalezEzequiel/issues/69) defines what we will track during beta testing:
- Goal creation frequency
- Task completion rates
- Daily/weekly active users
- Feature usage (e.g., streaks, shared boards)
- 1-, 7-, and 30-day retention

We plan to use a privacy-conscious analytics tool such as **Plausible**, **Mixpanel**, or **PostHog** to gather actionable data that supports product iteration.

### Use-Case Testing (UC5 – Goal Creation Flow)  
[Issue #70](https://github.com/GonzalezEzequiel-FS-1/2503-WDV349-GonzalezEzequiel/issues/70) describes a structured QA test focused on a core flow:
- Creating a new goal with subtasks
- Saving the goal
- Ensuring it's visible in the dashboard
- Measuring time to completion and ease-of-use rating
