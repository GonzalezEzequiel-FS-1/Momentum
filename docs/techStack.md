# Tech Stack

##### Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your final project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work?

For my tech stack I think I will go with what I'm most <em>comfortable</em> for now and keep adding as needed. I will Start with MERN and Redux for state management. In my opinion, MERN will cover **most** of my needs for this project. There are a few front and back end libraries that work well with them that I plan to use, which is an added bonus. <br>
I want to get more comfortable with TypeScript as well, so I think I will use Typescript on my project and just keep adding to the JS foundation research when needed and get more used to dealing with it on a daily basis <em>Gotta start at some point...</em>

## Application Design

##### What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well.

<br>

Styled components will be my main tool to start my journey, I think it gives me the resources to create modern and original looking components for my design and will allow me to work on my own term without restricting myself to any specific libraries. However, I am not closing myself at the idea of using common UI kits since they are extremely useful tools.

## Front End Framework

##### List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

As far as front end Vite-React will be my weapon of choice, I feel that it will allow me to create my app in a way I feel comfortable and familiar way.

## State Management

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).

I will be going for MongoDb as my Data Storage Solution, in regards to state I will be using Redux. **I don't have a lot of experience with Redux**, but this seems like the perfect chance to finally understand the store slices and all of that other nomenclature that has so far escaped my brain.

## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose?

Node will be an essential tool for this project without a doubt. Without NPM libraries like React-Calendar, I honestly think I wouldn't be able to create it.

Someone way smarter than me

## Express

##### Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

My app should be able to interact with the front end and DB storing user data per profile, lists and messages between users. Therefore, authentication middlewares and secure routes will be used, also controllers and models to send and receive data from the user and database. An API created with express will handle most of the workload.

## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

##### A popular solution for relational database work is to utilize Sequelize as an ORM. Are you familiar with migrations, models, and seeding? What tools and solutions do you propose for your application? For example, utilizing an ORM to build out models with full validated CRUD.

In regards to storing data I think that MongoDB will provide me with the scalability and adaptability to cover my needs. I am indeed familiar with SQL Postgress, Sequelize, migrations and seeding, and they are all extremely useful resources. This app will without a doubt ise the full CRUD spectrum, allowing the users to create their tasks, goals and sharing them with their team, partners or mentors.

## Notes / Updates

  Found [DiceBar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dicebear) for avatar creation, seems like a cool and useful option.

  Had to spend most of the week fixing an issue caused by a merge gone wrong, had the chance to learn a lot about git and how the process works. I was able to fix the issue and have the app back to work as it was prior to the mistake. Refactored part of the code and made it a bit more efficient. Also spent some time looking at options on to publish. If possible I would like to start it self hosted as part of the challenge, but options like AWS and linode look pretty cool.
